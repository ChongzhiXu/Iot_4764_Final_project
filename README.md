The City-Bin, a work that integrates technology and practicality, was designed for garbage sorting and new smart city services.
It can be deployed both in home or public areas such as city streets, served as a defender of environment. City-Bin uses yolov5 
Computer Vision Algorithm to process the image containing metal, paper, plastic trash collected by USB camera, and then rotate the 
lid with drop hole depending on the trash type returned by cloud server. Not only this, City-Bin could gather information about 
itself and upload it to the cloud, then display the percentage remaining capacity in each City-Bin on a visualized online map application.
